<h1>I'm starting a startup! An apartment with a view finder!</h1>

I can't tell you the name. Because I have not thought about a name yet. But I already know what it
is about. It will help you find apartments with
a view. This is my <b>personal itch</b> that I am scratching. I spend frivolous amounts of time
on finding such apartments. You can read about it
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16376165">here</a>.

<h2>Business Plan</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Build it
 <li>? (Probably learn a lot)
 <li>Happiness or profit or something. Don't know yet :)
</ol>

<h2>Values</h2>

In case this becomes a billion dollar unicorn, journalists will probably ask
me 'What was the magic trick? How did you get from nothing to a company that
changes so many lifes for the better and makes hundreds of millions in revenue
along the way?'. To prevent my then rich and arrogant self (hi dude, glad we made it!)
to talk nonsense, here are the core values I bet on:

<h3>* Do something that matters to you</h3>

So far, I have gotten zero positive response for this idea. Everybody says
the market is <b>too small</b> and it's <b>too hard</b> to do all the research.
All I can reply is: but
it matters to me. And my bet is that this has more power then market size
or how hard it is. Actually, I love hard problems.<br>
<br>
I love startups. I like to attend startup meetups. And I like to talk to
startup founders. I am often surprised that people work on something
that does not matter to them personally. And I think 'Is this really how
you want to invest your time and energy? You only have one stay on planet earth.
And you want to use it to build a marketing tool for loan comparisons? Or
a management system for SPF headers? Is this really what life is about?'.<br>
<br>
I have been putting time into finding the right apartments for years now. And
this will probably not change. This is the key reason why I think this idea is
the right idea for me.<br>
<br>
Doing a Google search for "apartments with a view in bangkok" brings up nothing.
Not even a spammy "Best 10 Apartments with a view in Bangkok" page which I would
have expected. Let alone an up to date, user friendly, honest, comprehensive list.
That's what I want to build. That's going to be my contribution to the internet.<br>
<br>
Of course it might possible to broaden the approach later. My bet is: It doesn't matter how
small I start. As long as it matters to me.

<h3>* Speed Uber Alles</h3>

I plan to spend zero time on planning, bureaucracy, design and best practices.
Just iterate based on user feedback. Take one step at a time as fast as possible.
At the moment I am the only user. So I scratch my own itch. Whatever comes to mind,
I do it. I want to only act on <b>real</b> user feedback. Never want to waste time
speculating about what others <b>might</b> want. If you have any feedback, let me know:
<b>getnothingless@outlook.com</b><br>
<br>
I will stick to free tools. Anything I have to pay for would just slow
me down. I would hesitate to sign up, I would hesitate to switch (if I already paid a
monthly or yearly subscription) I would hesitate to continue (if I have running costs).
So no paid services. That's why you are reading this on a GitHub page. Thanks GitHub!
I want to keep it that way. Whatever free tool comes in my way: I will just happily click
and try it. Since it's free, it's ok if it sucks. I can just stop using it tomorrow.

<h3>* Reach out and be open about everything</h3>
I plan to be open, be vulnerable and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DnFzP5kSxU">never hesitate to ask</a>.
As of yet, I have no idea how to do this. I don't even know how to set up an email
newsletter which everybody says is so important. If you want to be updated about this
journey, just send me an email.<br>
<br>
Being an introverted person, my typical approach would be to figure it all out on my own.
Sit in front of my computer, plan, analyze, research and compare until I have all information
to make an informed decision. My hypothesis is that this is way inferior to just ask and try. So I will make an experiment
and go against my natural habits.
<h3>* Measure</h3>
"What gets measured gets managed". I don't want to run around blindly. So I will try to find
good indicators of whats going on and measure them religiously. First of all I will measure
the time I put into this. Let's start now. 2018-02-19 10:08 UTC. 0 hours. 35 minutes. 0 seconds invested.
Yeah, I have been writing this text for 35 minutes now. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1915/">Embarrassing</a>, I know.<br>
<br>
I will keep a public log about the invested time.<br>
<br>

So these are the 4 guidelines to my new startup. Let's see where this goes. I will make an
updated list if I learn more along the way.
